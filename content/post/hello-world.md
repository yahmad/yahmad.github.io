My name is **Yasir Ahmad**.  
I am a software developer living in **Edinburgh, Scotland**.  

If you are interested in more about me, I have put some past details below - but to be honest, chatting to me
or having a look at my latest posts/projects is probably more informative.

## Currently

I am a founding (and the lead iOS) engineer at a startup called [Yavi](http://yaviapp.com), in Edinburgh. We are making a platform
for desk-free workers to improve their work lives through better communications.

As we are a relatively small team, I get to work all over our stack, from the back-end in Java,
front-end sites and internal tools using Angular and TypeScript - and of course the mobile apps!

It has been and continues to be a great learning experience, and I am working with some really talented people.

## Previous work
Following university, I have been working mainly in the mobile sector for the past 6+ years.  

I have created both iOS and Android apps, working on phone, tablet and occasionally desktop apps through the use of native and cross-platform tools.

Clients have included government contracts, NPOs, airlines, as well as well-known tech companies and banks.

## Education
I studied Applied Computing at the University of Dundee, achieving a 1st BSc (with Hons).

## Hobbies
My main pastime - when not coding at work - is coding at home. ðŸ˜…  
I like reading both fiction and non-fiction books, and occasionally play tennis in the summer.
Oh, I also have a network of fiercely competitive board-gaming friends. Who needs consoles?
